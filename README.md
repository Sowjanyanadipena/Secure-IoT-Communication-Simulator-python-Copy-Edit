# Secure IoT Communication Simulator
## Overview
This project simulates secure communication between IoT devices using Python sockets and AES-based symmetric encryption (Fernet).  
It demonstrates how IoT endpoints can exchange encrypted messages to ensure confidentiality and integrity.
## Features
- Client-server communication using sockets
- AES symmetric encryption (via Fernet) for secure message exchange
- Real-time encrypted chat simulation
- Easy to extend for IoT security workflows
## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- cryptography (Fernet)
- socket
- Jupyter/Colab or Local Python Environment
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
